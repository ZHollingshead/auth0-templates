# auth-templates

Collection of single page and full stack applications based on Aurelia Navigation Skeletons with support for authentication

***

This project is dedicated to the design and implementation of a series of Aurelia applications using **[Auth0](https://auth0.com/)** Platform as a Service (aka PaaS) - solution solving the most complex identity use cases with an extensible and easy to integrate platform that secures billions of logins every year.

Initially we plan to create four variations of the Aurelia Navigation Skeletons, all of which can claim complete functionality
#### 1. [skeleton es-next](https://github.com/aurelia-auth0/auth-templates/tree/master/skeleton-esnext) 
#### 2. [skeleton es-next-fs](https://github.com/aurelia-auth0/auth-templates/tree/master/skeleton-esnext-fs) (full-stack version)
#### 3. [skeleton typescript](https://github.com/aurelia-auth0/auth-templates/tree/master/skeleton-typescript)
#### 4. [skeleton typescript-fs](https://github.com/aurelia-auth0/auth-templates/tree/master/skeleton-typescript-fs) (full-stack version)

All these applications have the same front end - depicted below

and exhibit the same behavior, as documented here:

- The **`Welcome`** page is the default (Home) page.

- The **`GitHub Users`** page is "protected" - it requires authentication before it can be accessed. To make this most user friendly, click on the **`GitHub Users`** page results with the switch to the **`Login`** page.

- After a succesfull authentication, the application switches back to the **`GitHub users`** page automatically.
